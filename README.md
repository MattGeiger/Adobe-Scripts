# Adobe Automation Scripts

This repository contains ExtendScript-based automation scripts designed to streamline workflows in various Adobe programs, starting with Adobe Premiere Pro. These scripts automate repetitive tasks, helping editors and designers enhance their efficiency. 

## Features

- **Premiere Pro Automation**: The first script in this repository automates the import of multiple MP4 files into Adobe Premiere Pro and inserts them sequentially into the timeline. This script simplifies the process of organizing clips within a project.

- **Cross-Application Support**: While the initial focus is on Adobe Premiere Pro, this repository will expand to include scripts for other Adobe programs, such as After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator, in the future.
